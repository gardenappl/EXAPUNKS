# EXAPUNKS

My solutions to the game [EXAPUNKS](https://store.steampowered.com/app/716490/EXAPUNKS/) by [Zachtronics](https://www.zachtronics.com/) in which you need to solve puzzles by writing tiny programs in an [assembly-like language](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1480557969).

Missing the bonus campaign and achievements (didn't even knew there was any!), might add them eventually, I had so much fun! Will have to play other Zachtronics games as well.

There is no earth-shattering records here, I was playing for fun, aiming to get the less cycles. My solution to the last challenge is particulary bad (and interesting!) but I wanted to finish the game (might revisit it someday).

Also include a quick `.solution` (game's file format) parser to [auto-generate](EXA-Parser) this repo.

*Each of the solutions also include the auto-generated **GIFs** as well*
